This is currently primarily a professional site, so if you're considering working with me you've come to the right place. I currently offer three main kinds of services:

* **Technical consulting** -- I have a lot of experience across machine learning, statistical modeling, and data science, both in a research setting and in industry. If you have a project that needs support in one of these areas, don't hesitate to get in touch!

* **Teaching, coaching, and mentoring** -- I offer teaching/tutoring in machine learning, data science, statistics, and math. That can look like directly teaching material you're looking to learn, or providing help with a class. It can also look like offering coaching and mentoring on a project you're working on, if for instance you're new to machine learning, data science, or statistics, and need some help with what you're working on.

* **Facilitation** -- I lead events focused on communication and relational skills, including co-founding an [Authentic Relating](https://www.authrev.org/) community when I worked at Google (still going strong!). Authentic Relating events consist mostly of activities targeting specific skills or aspects of relating. I'm also available to lead circling, which is a more freeform approach.

Check out the tabs above for more info, or drop me a line by email using the contact info below.

If you're not here because you want to work with me, but want to get in touch for some other reason, feel free to shoot me an email.
