This is currently primarily a professional site, so if you're considering working with me you've come to the right place. I currently offer three main kinds of services:

* Technical consulting -- mainly, working on some machine learning, statistical modeling, or data science need you have. 

* Teaching, or tutoring -- covering a range of subjects, broadly in math, statistics, and computer science. 

* Facilitation -- which I can't do justice to in one sentence, but basically leading communication, connection, and community building practices. 

Check out the tabs above for more info, or drop me a line by email using the contact info below.

If you're not here because you want to work with me, but want to get in touch for some other reason, feel free to shoot me an email.
