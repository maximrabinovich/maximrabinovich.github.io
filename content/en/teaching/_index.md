Teaching falls into a couple of main categories: teaching and tutoring as such, and coaching and mentoring. Teaching and tutoring involves presenting new materials to students or supporting students working on a course or independent study. Coaching and mentoring usually involves supporting a student working on a project, whether for work or other specific goal or just general interest. These two categories can overlap of course! 

You can hire me to provide support in the form of teaching/tutoring or coaching/mentoring across a number of areas in math and computer science:

* Machine learning -- anything from probabilistic modeling to understanding modern transformer architectures

* Statistics -- anything from introductory statistics for non-statisticians, to graduate-level theoretical statistics classes

* Data science -- anything from understanding conceptually how some algorithm or method works, to getting comfortable implementing your analysis in Python/R

* Algorithms and data structures 

* Linear algebra

* Calculus (single variable and multivariable)

* Probability -- whether at an introductory level or a fully-rigorous measure-theoretic course

If your subject doesn't appear in this list, drop me a line and we can discuss your specific needs. I have a decade plus of experience doing research and studying in various parts of math and computer science, so my knowledge is wide-ranging. 

As much as possible when teaching, I prioritize helping the student develop deep understanding of the subject and fluency in using it. The goal is autonomy so the student can apply their skills on their own, whether for a test or in the context of a project they're working on. To achieve that we might work through practice problems or examples together, or I may offer mini-tutorials on the subject at hand. In all cases, I aim to meet the student where they're at and understand their thought process and experience. I find that's the best way to identify confusions and missing knowledge and to facilitate progress.

My standard rate for teaching and coaching is $100/hour.
